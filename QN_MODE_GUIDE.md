## 🎓 **Understanding Weak Words**

### **What Are Weak Words?**
Weak words are vague, overused words that dilute your message and make writing less impactful.

### **Categories of Weak Words:**

#### **1. Weak Verbs**
Generic verbs that lack specificity:
- get, got, have, make, do, go, come, put, take

**Why they're weak:** They're vague and don't paint a clear picture.

**Example:**
- ❌ "I got the information" 
- ✅ "I obtained the information" (more professional)
- ✅ "I discovered the information" (more specific)

#### **2. Intensifiers**
Words that try to add emphasis but actually weaken:
- very, really, quite, pretty, extremely, incredibly

**Why they're weak:** They're overused and add no real meaning.

**Example:**
- ❌ "This is very important"
- ✅ "This is critical" (stronger, more precise)

#### **3. Filler Words**
Verbal pauses with no meaning:
- um, uh, like, you know, so, basically, I mean

**Why they're weak:** They're just noise in speech.

#### **4. Hedge Words**
Words that show uncertainty and weaken confidence:
- maybe, perhaps, possibly, kind of, sort of, somewhat

**Why they're weak:** They make you sound unsure.

**Example:**
- ❌ "This might be a good approach"
- ✅ "This is a good approach" (more confident)

#### **5. Redundant Phrases**
Phrases that repeat the same idea:
- "past history", "future plans", "end result", "final outcome"

**Why they're weak:** Redundancy adds no value.

## 🎯 **QN Mode Transformation Rules**

### **1. Remove Redundancy**
- "past history" → "history"
- "future plans" → "plans"
- "completely finished" → "finished"

### **2. Combine Choppy Sentences**
**❌ Before:**
```
I went to the store. I bought milk. I came home.
```

**✅ After:**
```
I went to the store, bought milk, and returned home.
```

### **3. Replace Weak Verbs**
- "get better" → "improve"
- "make a decision" → "decide"
- "do an analysis" → "analyze"

### **4. Eliminate Passive Voice**
**❌ Passive:**
```
The report was written by John.
```

**✅ Active:**
```
John wrote the report.
```

### **5. Fix Run-On Sentences**
**❌ Before:**
```
I like coding and I think it's fun and I do it every day and it's my passion.
```

I enjoy coding daily. It's my passion.
